variable types

instance variable  - these vars are created at class level. when you create object or instance of class, you can use these variables and assign any value.
local variable - created inside method.
static variable - if you want all object to have same value of a particular variable, then declare it as static. i.e static variables are shared by all objects.
so if you change value of static variable, it will reflect in all objects.

If you see in below example, the eyes remain same for all animals i.e 2 . we dont need to explicity declare again n again in all objects. rather declare it
static. And it should be therefore called by class name and not object name.

class Animal {
 String name;
 int legs;
 static int eyes;

 public static void main() {
    Animal a = new Animal();
    a.name =  "dog";
    a.legs = 4;
    Animal.eyes = 2;

    Animal b = new Animal();
    b.name =  "cat";
    b.legs = 4;
    Animal.eyes = 2;
 }
}

why main in static ?
if we make main method non static, then it has to be accessed via object. we have to create object of main class. but main in the starting point of exectuion
if execution itself did not start how do we create its object. thats why main in static.

static block
