An abstract class cannot be instantiated i.e its object cannot be created.
( class is a blueprint of objects. when we create object of class it means we are creating instance of class.
  Instantiation means , creating object of class )
If a class have abstract and non abstract method, it is called abstract class.
if a class have even 1 abstract method, the class should be declared as abstract.
If a child class extends abstract class, then it must implement all its methods.

abstract class vehicle() {
   abstract void speed();   // method w.o body is called abstract method
   void brakes() {          // full method
   }
}

public class bike extends vehicle(){
@Override
void speed(){};

@Override
void brakes(){};
}
