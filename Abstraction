# The main method should only allow user to call the methods but it should not expose how the method is written. This is called abstraction.

When you create object and if you want to set some default values of the object properties, we use constructor. Intead of using setter to set value, we can use
contructor.
For ex: we create  object of bike, and we want to set a default speed of bike.

public class Bike() {

class Bike(int speed) {
  speed = this.speed;
}}

## when we create object
Bike b = new Bike();  / Bike() is the contructor i.e we are setting its default value once object is created.
