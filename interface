a fully abstract class is called interface. Like abstract class,  we cannot create object of interface.
Interface is impemented using implement keyword.
all the methods should be implemented by the class impementing the interface.

- by default all the methods are abstract in interface, we dont need to explicltly specify method as abstract.
- all the methods are public by default so that it can be implemented by the classes.
- the advantage of using interface is that a class can implement multiple interfaces compared to abstract class which can be extended only 1
- Interfaces allows us to achieve multiple inheritance.
- fields in interface are public, static, final by default, so you dont need to explicitly define. 

- since 100s of classes may have implemented an interface, if you add any new method to interface then all the classes implementing that interface will start
  throwing error. To avoid this, java provides a default method in interface which classes can override anytime when user want and will not be compulsary to be
  implemented. The default method is concrete method i.e with a body.

  default void walking(){
    System.out.println("Animal is walking");
  }
