lets consider a class having x,y,z methods.
another class also implement the same method x,y,z.
This causes duplicacy. To avoid this, the second class can use the same methods already available. 
first class is called parent class, second class is called child class. This concept is called Inheritance.
The keyword extends is used to define a subclass.

now, after the methods are inherited you can provide your own custom implementation to the parent methods. This is called method over riding.
Also known as run time polymorphism.

Types of inheritance:
single inheritance : father-child relation
multi level inheritance :  grandfather - father - child relation
heirarchial inheritance :  father - child1 child2 child3 child4

multiple inheritance : father1 father2 - child   :) not allowed.
