Collection is a root interface in the Java Collections Framework. It is part of the java.util package.

List is an interface which extends collection interface. 
List maintains order.
Allows duplicate elements.

classes which implement Interface
---------------------------------
ArrayList
LinkedList

If the goal is to have faster access to list elements ---> ArrayList
intertion,removal is slow in arraylist.

If the goal is to have faster insertion and removal of elements ---> LinkedList
access is slow in linkedlist.

List<String> books = new ArrayList<>();
books.add("The Hobbit");
books.remove("1984");
books.contains("hobbit")

How do you convert an array to a List in Java ?
Using Arrays.asList():

String[] array = {"yash", "ram", "bom"};
List<String> list = Arrays.asList(array);
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));

why would we convert a array to list ?
The List interface provides more functionality than arrays. For example, you can easily add, remove, or modify elements, whereas arrays have a fixed size 
and do not provide such methods. Also other methods like Sorting the list, shuffling the list.
Collections.sort(list);
Collections.shuffle(list);
