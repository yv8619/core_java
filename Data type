Type Casting
------------
  Assigning one primitive data type to another type is called type casting.
  - upcasting or implicit casting or widening casting ( if you are promoting small data type to big data type compiler do not oppose. just like our promotion :) )
  - downcasting or explicit casting or narrowing casting ( its like demotion, compiler would complain. big data type to small data type )

  big data type = small data type;   // upcasting
  small data type = ( small data type ) big data type;     // downcasting

  upcasting - no loss of data.
  downcasting - loss of data
