Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call 
in different ways. It's a key feature that allows for flexibility and the extension of code without modifying existing code. 

compile time polymorphism -- through method overloading
run time polymorphism -- through method overriding

- Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters (different type, number, or both).
- Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass 
  must have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass.
