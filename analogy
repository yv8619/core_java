class - home
object - humans
variables - age, height
methods - human behaviour like eating , sleeping etc
interface -  interface can be thought of a blueprint that all homes must follow, like having a door, windows, behaviour . How these door, 
             window, behaviour is to be,  should be implemented by user.

ex:
AccountNumberResponse getLoanDetail(RequestHeader requestHeader) {}

so , using a behaviour we are returning which home it would be. If the behaviour is bad having habbits of drinking,smoking(method params we pass)
we would say it is home 1520. and that home would have its own behavours and variables.
