# Array

int[] arr1 = new int[5];
int[] arr2 = new int[]{1,2,4,5,6};
int[] marks = {1,2,3,4,5};  ---> shortest way to initialize array

Iterate through array --

for(int mark:marks){
  sum = sum + mark;
}

If you want to print array directly on console w.o iterating it , use Arrays.toString()
String[] names = {"yash","ram","bom"};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(names));

whats the difference in using enhanced for loop and Arrays.toString() to print array content on console
The enhanced for loop iterates over each element of the array and allows you to perform custom operations on each element, including printing them. 
where as Arrays.toString() only prints the content as is , you cannot perform any operation on the elements.

# array comparison
int[] arr1 = {1,2,4,5,6};
int[] arr2 = {1,2,4,5,6};
Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2);
