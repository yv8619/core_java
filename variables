# why we create private variables 

If we do not want users to directly change value of variable, we set the variables as private so that we can assign a setter and getter method aorund it. 
Also, we can set some conditions or rules inside the setter getter methods to set a value of varialbe by user. This is called encapsulation.

   public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    // Setting rules to provide author name and handling exception if invalid username provided.
    public void setAuthor(String author) {
        if(!author.isEmpty() && author.matches("[a-zA-Z ]+")){
        this.author = author;
    } else {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("enter valid author");
        }
    }
